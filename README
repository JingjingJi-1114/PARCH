Please note:

PARCH has been implemented into the Nangia research group website at http://www.parchscale.org. PARCH is a fully automated workflow and the only input is the protein pdb structure.


Attached are code scripts, including: 

(1) pp_eqb_1.py (protein equilibration) 
(2) pp_refill_annealing_2.py (model preparation and annealing process)
(3) water_analysis_3.py (water analysis)
(4) 4_pv_correlation.py (autocorrelation function calculations)
(5) ave_pv_5.py (parch values are written into .pdb file and file correction)

main.py is used to trigger the whole process.

code_sample_1.py: autocorrelation function calculations
code_sample_2.py: Analysis of amino acid colocalization (e.g., triad, tetrad, pentad, etc)
